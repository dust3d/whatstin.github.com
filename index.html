  <h2>First Post</h2>
  <p>Just getting started.  Seth Godin says to write every day.  So, here we go.  His latest book <em>The Icarus Deception</em> 
  makes it clear that the marketplace values uniqueness.  It values Self expression.  Normal people get outsourced and automated.
  Seth calls it Art.  The only thing you can do that can't be outsourced or automated
  is the unique thing that only you can do.  You're a snowflake.  The lifelong question of
  <blockquote>Why am I here?</blockquote> is a difficult one to answer but it's something
  that needs to continually asked.  The two questions <blockquote>Who am I?</blockquote> and <blockquote>Why am I here?</blockquote> need to 
  be continually asked, answered, and iterated on.  We need experience to truly shine but that
  doesn't mean we shouldn't start shining.  As we shine and see that we're not shining as bright as we know we can, it
  requires us to continue polishing our craft.  A lifelong commitment to refining
  your unique Self expression has the promise of leaving us satisfied and maybe
  even having done something amazing that can get us the unique reward that you crave.</p>
